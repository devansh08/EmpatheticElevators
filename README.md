# Empathetic Elevators
This project is a simulation of an idea for a smart elevator system which was selected in KONE-IBM HACKATHON. The proposed system has the capability to handle medical emergencies effectively. The elevator system continuously monitors its passengers for any anomaly behavior and immediately alerts the required staff.
As a team member, I was involved in developing the core logic for the simulator using JAVA.
